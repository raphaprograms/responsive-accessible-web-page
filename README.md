# responsive-accessible-web-page

- This project is a demostration of the ability to use semantic HTML and to make a website responsive using Flexbox and CSS Grid 
harmoniously. As well as an intro into using ARIA for accessibility. To demostrate that functionality try resizing the page to
see the grid items and the flex items adjust to those changes. Also try out the nav links!


- What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
- Making Grid and Flexbox work together was tricky at first, but using a tip from the instructors, which was to place borders
around the items and sections helped for visualization fro knowing what to do. Also making one change at a time really helped. 

- How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
- I made sure that ever image has alt text and each label was matched to an input unsing "for" and "id" amoung other attributes.
The ARIA  accessibility features wer tricky but I added them where it seemed to be relevant. A lot of the semantic HTML elements have thoe ARIA benefits buitl in but stll I used it where it made sense to me.

- What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
- I used google a lot. Of course the module lessons were invaluable as well to make sure I was on track and covering the intended
teahing points of the lesson.
